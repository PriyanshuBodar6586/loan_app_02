The $pStrLoanType loan processing fee is a one-time non-refundable charge that borrowers are required to pay to the $pStrLoanType loan lenders.

Step 3 : Discussion with your bank

After paying the processing fees, the bank or loan lenders check the authenticity of documents shared. This process generally takes two to three days; however, if the documentation is done correctly, this part of the $pStrLoanType loan process gets over quickly. Later on, the bank asks the applicant for a face-to-face interaction to discuss further details of the $pStrLoanType loan.
The discussion is generally meant to confirm the repaying capabilities of the applicant. However, you can clear your doubts regarding the $pStrLoanType loan during a conversation with the bank. Banks help their customers at each stage of the $pStrLoanType loan application process.
